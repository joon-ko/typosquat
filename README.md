Siamese lets you explore domain names for awareness and potential prevention of [typosquatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typosquatting). Provide a domain name, and Siamese returns a list of similar domain names that are likely to be used for typosquatting.

All returned domain names come with information on whether or not that domain name is available. If a domain name is not available, it may be worth it to research the associated web site to check if it's exhibiting malicious behavior that is characteristic of typosquatters. If a domain name is available for purchase, its price is shown. Click on the domain name to be taken to GoDaddy's purchase page for that domain name.
